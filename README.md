# Real-Time Hurricane Detection Using Satellite Imagery

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for detecting hurricanes in real time using satellite imagery. By training a model on historical hurricane images, the system learns to identify visual patterns associated with hurricane formation. It then applies this knowledge to live satellite data, captured either through screen recording or direct feed, to monitor and analyze atmospheric conditions continuously.

The ultimate goal is to provide early visual indicators of hurricane development, supporting meteorological research and potentially aiding in disaster preparedness. This approach combines computer vision, real-time data processing, and deep learning to create a responsive and scalable detection tool.
